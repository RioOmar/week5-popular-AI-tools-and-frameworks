What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, widely used for building and training deep learning models.
Key Features:

Supports both deep learning and traditional machine learning models.
Compatible with CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
Automatic differentiation with GradientTape.
High-level Keras API for easier model building.
TensorFlow Lite for mobile applications.
TensorFlow.js for running models in web browsers.


2.
What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (also called define-and-run), meaning the graph is defined first and then executed.
PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run), which are built and modified on the fly during execution, making debugging and experimentation easier.


3.
What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API that simplifies deep learning model creation.
It can run on top of:

TensorFlow (default backend)
Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)
Theano (now discontinued)


4.
What are the key features of Scikit-learn?

Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning.
Key Features:

Simple and consistent API.
Wide range of algorithms (classification, regression, clustering).
Data preprocessing tools.
Model evaluation and selection tools.
Built-in datasets like Iris and Digits.


5.
What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?

Jupyter Notebooks are web-based interactive development environments for writing and running code.
Key Features:

Supports multiple programming languages.
Code execution with inline results.
Markdown support for documentation.
Interactive data visualization.
Easy sharing and collaboration.


6.
In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?

The Dropout layer randomly drops a fraction of input units during training to prevent overfitting by making the network more robust.


7.
What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?

The optimizer updates the modelâ€™s weights to minimize the loss function. The commonly used optimizer in PyTorch is Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).


8.
In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?

The Conv2D layer performs convolution operations on images, automatically extracting important features like edges, textures, and shapes.


9.
What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?

The model is typically a Logistic Regression classifier applied to the Iris dataset.


10.
What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?

The output is a data visualization like a scatter plot or histogram. The visualization is generated using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
